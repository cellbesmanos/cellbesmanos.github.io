				<h1>Movies Dataset Exploration</h1>

				<h4><strong>Dataset Used:</strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies"> Movies Dataset</a></h4>
				<h4><strong>Skills Highlighted:</strong> Data Transformation, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization</h4>
				<hr>

				<section>
					<p>&emsp; Before I start in data wrangling (data cleaning, transformation, etc.), <strong>I want to make sure I understand what the dataset
					is about.</strong> Thus, I often read the metadata (description of the data) of the dataset provided by its owner. There were only 
					seven-thousand five hundred twelve unique observations (rows) in the dataset, which Excel can easily handle.</p>

					<p>&emsp; I noticed that some of the column names are difficult to understand without its metadata. Therefore, <strong>I decided to rename
					these columns, so I can avoid potential confusion in the future.</strong></p>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
							<h4>Columns renamed:</h4>

							<ul>
								<li><strong>year to year_released</strong> (The year it was released)</li>
								<li><strong>released to date_released</strong> (The date it was released)</li>
								<li><strong>score to imdb_score</strong> (Movie score from the IMDB (Internet Movie Database) Website</li>
								<li><strong>votes to imdb_votes</strong> (The number of votes it received from IMDB)</li>
								<li><strong>country to country_imdb_rating</strong> (The country where the votes came from)</li>
								<li><strong>gross to gross_revenue</strong> (The revenue minus the expenses)</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>


					<p>&emsp; I turned the data range into a table. Tables in Excel gives the user additional tools that help with thier anlaysis.
					Next, <strong>I added a filter to my table to quickly scan if some of our columns have empty values.</strong> I noticed that the rating column has 
					empty values.</p>

					<p>&emsp; I used this formula to fill the blank values with "No Rating". This checks if the cells were empty. If True, it will enter "No Rating",
					and if False it will take the current value instead.</p>

					<pre>
						<code>=IF(ISBLANK([@rating]), "No Rating", [@rating])</code>
					</pre>

					<p>&emsp; Empty values were also present in the writer, star, company, and imdb_country_rating, so I used the same procedure to fill in <strong>(I used "NA" instead of "No Rating")</strong> the blank values.</p>

					<p>&emsp; I also noticed empty cells in imdb_votes, imdb_score, gross_revenue, budget, and runtime. However, <strong>these columns contains numbers.
					</strong>, and <strong>I don't want to fill it with "NA"s that are string.</strong> I want to <strong>make sure that each of the columns have their
					rows in a same data type.</strong></p>

					<p>&emsp; Initially, I was thinking of dropping these values because it might skew the analysis later. However, after inspection, out of seven-thousand five hundrd unique obseervations, thirty percent of it has empty cells either in imdb_votes, imdb_score,gross_revenue, budget, or runtime columns.</p>

					<blockquote>In real world scenarios, I will ask my project manager or stakeholders for a more complete dataset or use a proxy data.</blockquote>

					<p>&emsp; I decided to replace these empty cells with number zero. <strong>I used the previous formula for empty values in rating</strong> because it also works for this scenario.</p>

					<p>I noticed that there were two values in the date_released that were empty. <strong>There were only two values, so I decided to look up their values in the IMDB website.</strong> I chose their U.S.A. released date because the majority of the data were in U.S.A. Next, the values in date_released were stored as strings and not dates. Moreover, the values also has the country where it was released.<strong> I decided to use text-to-columns feature in Excel to separate the two.</strong>However, this will return an inconsistent and messy results because we don't have a distinct separator.</p>

					<blockquote>Spaces are out of the question. The date_released column has country names that have two or more words in them. Using spaces as delimiters will also separate these country names.</blockquote>

					<!-- Include an example -->

					<p>&emsp; After spending some time with it, I decided to create a formula that will take the specific space between the date and the country name. Then, replace that space with an underscore. <strong>Replacing the space with an underscore guarantees that the date and country name has a distinct separator.</strong> Then we will use the text to columns tool in Excel to seprate them.</p>

					<pre>
						<code>=REPLACE($A1, FIND("(", $A1) - 1, 1, "_")</code>
					</pre>

					<p>&emsp; The country name extracted from date_released columns has parethenses around them and I do not need that. Thus, <strong>I used this formula to take only the country name.</strong></p>

					<pre>
						<code>=MID([@[@date_released]], FIND("(", [@[date_released]]) + 1, (LEN([@[date_released]]) - FIND("(", [@[date_released]])) - 1)</code>
					</pre>

					<p>&emsp; This will tell Excel to extract the characters after the first parenthesis up to the character before the last parenthesis.</p>


					<p>&emsp; The string formatted dates still gave me some trouble. I tried multiple conversions through Excel but it does not change every instance. 
					So, <strong>I decided to use Python for converting these dates.</strong></p>

					<p>&emsp; After importing the transformed dataset in Jupyter Notebook (A place to run Python code), I want <strong>make sure that all my columns has no empty values. This line of code will return the total number of empty cells in each row.</strong></p>

					<pre>
						<code>movies_clean.isnull().sum()</code>
					</pre>

					<p>&emsp; Next, I used this line of code to <strong>convert the string dates into a datetime format and store the converted into a new column</strong></p>

					<pre>
						<code>movies_clean['date_released_fix'] = pd.to_datetime(movies_clean['date_released'])</code>
					</pre>

					<p>&emsp; I no longer need the string dates from the year_released column so I decided to drop it. Moreover, I want to rename the date_released_fix column to date_released. Finally, I noticed that the year_released columns has their values different from the year in the date_released column. I used this line
					of code to <strong>extract the year in the date_released column and replace the valus in the year_released column.</strong></p>

					<pre>
						<code># we will drop the original date_released column so that date_released_fix will remain <br>movies_clean.drop(columns = ['date_released'], inplace = True) <br><br># renaming the date_released_fix columns back to date_released<br>movies_clean.rename(columns = {'date_released_fix': 'date_released'}, inplace = True)<br><br># so we will extract the year in the date_released column and replace the <br># values in year_released column using it <br>year_fix = movies_clean['date_released'].dt.year <br><br># replace the year_released values with the values of year_fix Series <br>movies_clean['year_released'] = year_fix
						</code>
					</pre>

					<p>&emsp; This is the last step for my data cleaning process. Now, I decided to <strong>answer a question using this dataset and present it using Tableau.</strong> This is the question decided to ask:</p>

					<blockquote>Are the number of Action movies steadily increased from 1980 to 2020?</blockquote>

					<p>&emsp; I created three different charts that shows the growth and number of Action movies released from 1980 to 2020. Lastly, I combined them to create a dashboard and provided my interpretation.</p>
